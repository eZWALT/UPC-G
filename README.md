# Computer Graphics 2 (G)

## Description

This repository contains resources, exercises and solved laboratory tests and exercises related to the Graphics (G) subject 2022-23 Q2 FIB-GEI, which was my second graphics subject where I gathered even more OpenGL and computer graphics experience and expertise.

## Contents

- **theory-exams**: Previous solved and unsolved theory tests.
- **theory-resources**: A huge collection of theory slides and resources to understand modern graphics.
-**lab-exams**: My own solutions to some past laboratory tests and exams.
-**lab-exercises**: My own solutions to previous laboratory exercises.
-**OpenGL-arena**: GLArena program which should be overwritten with a fresh new installation to avoid any potential issues.

## Usage 

In order to easily execute and test out the various OpenGL shader programs and plugins from the laboratory, you are given out an easy-to-use and out-of-the-box program interface called the **GLArena** and can be found inside the OpenGL-arena directory. In order to install it and execute it:

To build the software clone this repository
```sh
git clone https://gitrepos.virvig.eu/docencia/newviewer
```
Change into the new directory
```sh
cd newviewer
```
and build:
```
qmake; make
```
Then run the most appropiate version of the program:
```sh
./GLarena
```

More details can be found on the official README file of the GLArena viewer. When the GLArena is open now one can easily load existing or new shader programs or plugins.
